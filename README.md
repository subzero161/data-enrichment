HHA 507, Assignment 3, AHI, SBU

write python code that will enrich SPARCS.csv with public health information from the Neighborhood Atlas 
(Optional) one other source (US Census?) to make things interesting. 

Neighborhood Atlas Downloaded from: https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/

For Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS) data (.csv), use https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8

Download the .csv file from the EXPORT -> CSV for Excel format. Data used from 2015 NYDOH Hospital Inpatient Discharges (SPARCS de-identified).

The data that you decide to enrich with, should be based/linked to either a zipcode, county, city, or state level to the SPARCS.csv
